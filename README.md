##### INFOS

This project was born from: https://github.com/beboxos/P4wnP1_ALOA_OLED_MENU_V2, since python2.7 is deprecated and therefore no longer compatible with the libraries in use, I opened a Fork, updated the code to Python3.7 and made a PullRequest.

Since the original repo seems to be no longer maintained, I decided to open a new one with the updates made, so that everyone can take advantage of this fantastic project of https://github.com/beboxos again.

If BeboXos returns to his repo this will be closed, and i hope so.

All rights to the original code are owned by BeboXos.

## what's new
* I updated the code to work with python3.7, fixed some bugs and added new features.
* new functions to make easier improving the code,see MANUAL.md
* update the gui-code via gui-option
* hosts discovery
* nmap on a specific host and save the report
* vulnerability scan (experimental...help me)
* Deauther(Jammer-like) on Wifi AP (60s, for continuous mode delete "timeout 60s" in the gui.py/deauther() function"
* Deauther(Jammer-like) on a specific client
* ArpPoisoning, saving HttpUrls, HttpUserPass,HttpsUrls, Mails. Output in the current directory (working on)
* TODO others

## known bugs
* using DEauther breaks WIFI and BLT connections, so you need to restart your Rasp
* some templates need to be executed 2 times, due to a P4wnp1 bug


## Installation:

* On boot partition edit config.txt to set I2C and SPI to active (in termnial you can type: nano /boot/config.txt)

edit:

         dtparam=i2c_arm=on
         dtparam=i2c1=on

and find and set spi section:

         dtparam=spi=on
* Download the current repo: git clone https://github.com/FuocomanSap/P4wnp1-ALOA-Menu-Reworked.git

###### Note for i2c: (on gui.py)

     uncomment the "bus = smbus.SMBus(0)  # 0 = /dev/i2c-0 (port I2C0), 1 = /dev/i2c-1 (port I2C1)" line
     set USER_I2C=1
     (if ups) set UPS=1

###### Note for SPI: (on gui.py) (currently set like this)

    comment the "bus = smbus.SMBus(0)  # 0 = /dev/i2c-0 (port I2C0), 1 = /dev/i2c-1 (port I2C1)" line
    set USER_I2C=0
    (if you have a ups) set UPS=1

* chmod +x install.sh update.sh
* run: "bash install.sh",
the script will automatically install all the files needed




##### GPIO 8 keys are default waveshare hat

you can edit to set to your hat if different
* GPIO
* KEY_UP_PIN     : 6,
* KEY_DOWN_PIN   : 19,
* KEY_LEFT_PIN   : 5,
* KEY_RIGHT_PIN  : 26,
* KEY_PRESS_PIN  : 13,
* KEY1_PIN       : 21,
* KEY2_PIN       : 20,
* KEY3_PIN       : 16



## Start at boot
in P4wnP1 web interface , create a trigger action that runs the script runmenu.sh in you default template (by default startup)
select the script runmenu.sh.
* open the web interface
* select Tigger action
* add one
* select runmenu.sh
* select store and type startup

## Improve the code
* see MANUAL.md
